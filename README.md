#### **Assignment : Colors-Toggle**

#### **Result:** Take a look at this project :https://colortoggle-dac3f5.netlify.app/

## Description

With this final assignment you will create your first toggle menu with JavaScript.
It will be a drop-down menu that allows you to change the background color of your web page.

## requirements:

Your project must meet these minimum requirements:

> - As a user I want to be able to click on a hamburger icon that expands when I click on it.
>   Use ul and li for the menu.
> - Focus mainly on the JavaScript (so little time on the CSS)
> - You will need a hamburger icon for your menu:
> - As a user I want to have a choice of colors in the expanded menu (written out in text). Each item in the menu is one color.
> - As a user I want to be able to click on one of the colors.
> - When I as a user have clicked on the color in the menu, the background color of the entire page changes to the color clicked.
> - When I as a user click on the color in the menu, the menu collapses again.

## Bonus Requirements

> - As a user I don't just want to read the color names, I also want to be able to see the colors in the menu. Each "row" in the menu has a color.
> - As a user I want to be able to click on a radio button of the color of my choice, so that I can see from the radio button what the current color is that is "active" at the moment.
> - As a user, instead of clicking my mouse, I want to hover over the hamburger, which will bring up the menu. When I, as a user, leave the hamburger with my mouse, the menu disappears again.
> - As a user I want to see the name of the background color in the background in addition to the changing background color when I clicked it.
> - As a user I want to see the menu slowly slide into view and slide out of view again, instead of appearing suddenly (do this with CSS transitions). (the direction doesn't matter!)
> - Change the colors by using keyboard keys (1 for home, 2 for red, 3 for orange, etc.) â‡’ \*\*\*\* here you need a new Event Type ...
